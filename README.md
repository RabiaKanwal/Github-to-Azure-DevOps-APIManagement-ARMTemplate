# Github to Azure DevOps API Management Template


From Azure DevOps this tempalate in Github is accessed and provisioned, and a new API Management Service is created in Azure.

This solution also supports continuous integration, so everytime this github project is commited a DevOps release is created and a new API management service is created in Azure.

By using these principles all Azure services and resources can be provisioned on demand via integration with Azure DevOps and Github.
